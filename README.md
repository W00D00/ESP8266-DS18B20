# ESP8266-DS18B20
A simple wifi sensor based on the NodeMCU firmware with a temperature sensor and a web server plus ThingSpeak logging.

The GPIO0 of the ESP8266 is used to the DS18B20 sensor with a 4.7 KOhm pullup resistor.

Need to compile the "main.lua" file because of the memory limit of the ESP8266 module.
